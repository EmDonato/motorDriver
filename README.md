# MotorDriver Library for ESP32 üõ†Ô∏è

Welcome to the **MotorDriver** library, designed for controlling DC motors using the **L298N motor driver** on the **ESP32** platform. This library allows you to control the speed and direction of up to two motors via **PWM**.

## üöÄ Overview

This library provides an easy-to-use interface to control **one or two motors** connected to an L298N motor driver. It supports **PWM speed control** and **direction control** (forward/backward).

## üíª Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmDonato/motorDriver.git
```
### Step 2: Add to Arduino Libraries

Copy the motorDriver folder into your Arduino libraries directory:

    Windows: Documents/Arduino/libraries/

    Mac/Linux: ~/Arduino/libraries/

Once the library is installed, restart the Arduino IDE if it was open.
## üõ†Ô∏è Features

- **One or Two Motors Control**: Easily manage up to two motors.
- **PWM Speed Control**: Control the motor speed via PWM signals.
- **Forward and Backward Motion**: Direct the motors to move in both directions.
- **ESP32 Compatibility**: Fully compatible with ESP32 development boards.

## üö¶ Quick Start Guide

To get started, include the MotorDriver.h file in your sketch and initialize the motors.
Example Code

```bash
#include "MotorDriver.h"

// Initialize motor control for one motor
L298N motor(0, 5000, 8, 1);  // PWM Channel, Frequency, Resolution, Number of Motors

void setup() {
    motor.init(18, 19, 21); // Pin configuration for the motor
}

void loop() {
    motor.forward(200);   // Move motor forward with PWM value 200
    delay(1000);          // Wait for 1 second

    motor.backward(200);  // Move motor backward
    delay(1000);

    motor.stop();         // Stop the motor
    delay(1000);          // Wait for 1 second
}
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Dependencies

This library is designed for ESP32 and requires the ledcWrite() function for PWM control. Ensure that you have the ESP32 board package installed in the Arduino IDE.
